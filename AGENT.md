# Agent Instructions

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **MANDATORY STARTUP STEP**: Upon starting a new session or entering this project, the AI Agent **MUST** immediately read `skills/SKILL.md` to index all available standards and architectural patterns. Do not proceed with code generation until you have understood the patterns in the `skills/` directory.

Rules for contributing to this repository.

## Style Guidelines

- **No emojis** in any markdown files or code comments
- Use `Yes/No` in tables instead of checkmarks or emoji
- Keep examples concise and focused
- Use `// Bad:` and `// Good:` comments in code examples
- Follow existing file patterns in `skills/nextjs/` and `skills/spring/`

## File Structure

Each skill topic should have:
- Clear heading with brief description
- Detection rules or patterns (if applicable)
- Code examples showing bad vs good patterns
- Quick reference table at the end

## Code Examples

```tsx
// Bad: description of the problem
<problematic code>

// Good: description of the solution
<correct code>
```

```java
// Bad: description of the problem
<problematic code>

// Good: description of the solution
<correct code>
```
